/*
(Integer Equivalent of a Character) Here is a peek ahead. In this chapter you learned about
integers and the type int. C++ can also represent uppercase letters, lowercase letters and a considerable
variety of special symbols. C++ uses small integers internally to represent each different character.
The set of characters a computer uses and the corresponding integer representations for those
characters are called that computerâ€™s character set. You can print a character by enclosing that character
acter in single quotes, as with
    cout << 'A'; // print an uppercase A
You can print the integer equivalent of a character using static_cast as follows:
    cout << static_cast<int>('A'); // print 'A' as an integer

This is called a cast operation (we formally introduce casts in Chapter 4). When the preceding
statement executes, it prints the value 65 (on systems that use the ASCII character set). Write a
program that prints the integer equivalent of a character typed at the keyboard. Store the input in a
variable of type char. Test your program several times using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits
and special characters (such as $).
